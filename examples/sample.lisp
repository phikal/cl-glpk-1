;;; This file corresponds to EXAMPLES/SAMPLE.C in the GLPK distribution.

;;; The linear problem, which is solved by the functions in this file,
;;; is described in Section 1.3 of the GLPK manual.

;;; Currently there are two implementations:

;;; sample              -- uses the low-level FFI bindings directly
;;; sample-medium-level -- uses a lispier interface (see lisp-api.lisp)
